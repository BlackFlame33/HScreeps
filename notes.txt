------------------------
continuously remember:
All special constants should be available at the top of each class!
monitor creeps stuck in loops

TODO:



pickup dropped resources on its path if possible
place its stuff in nearby container if possible

all **idle** creeps should move to storage and place all its content in storage
    recycle creeps if there are many idle!
