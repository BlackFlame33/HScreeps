------------------------
continuously remember:
All special constants should be available at the top of each class!
monitor creeps stuck in loops
cache calculated stuff in memory or creep memory
reuse code with functions

TODO:

pickup dropped resources on its path if possible
place its stuff in nearby container if possible
and if bypassing an empty spawn/extension and you carry energy

all **idle** creeps should move to storage and place all its content in storage
    recycle creeps if there are many idle!
