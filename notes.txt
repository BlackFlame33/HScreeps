harvesters and mineral harvester should TRY to place itself over a container SOL: JUST PLACE WALLS
transporters should have a task to supply containers near the controller

---------------------
algorithm problem: forever transporter jobs that blocks spawns in getting energy
if transporter is filling shooting tower - then it will go on forever and spawns wont get energy!!!
if container is being filled forever p√• harvester and transporter got fullContainer job - then it will try and empty forever! - cannot release carry if there are more than one kind being carried
also if container was a droppedResource being filled up continuously

------------------------
continuously remember:
All special constants should be available at the top of each class!



reorganize all creeps to have a file of its own - or jobs?.. hm... maybe.... hm... definitely each job... but how smart is that?
