harvesters and mineral harvester should TRY to place itself over a container
transporters should have a task to supply containers near the controller

---------------------
algorithm problem: forever transporter jobs that blocks spawns in getting energy
if transporter is filling shooting tower - then it will go on forever and spawns wont get energy!!!
if container is being filled forever p√• harvester and transporter got fullContainer job - then it will try and empty forever!
also if container was a droppedResource

------------------------
continuously remember:
All special constants should be available at the top of each class!




Handle creep death more smooth in the existing setup.
