------------------------
continuously remember:
All special constants should be available at the top of each class!
monitor creeps stuck in loops

TODO:

reorganize all creeps to have a file of its own - or jobs?.. hm... maybe.... hm... definitely each job... but how smart is that?
all idle creeps should move to storage and place all its content in storage
pickup dropped resources on its path if possible
place its stuff in nearby container if possible
